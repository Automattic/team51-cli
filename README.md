# Team51 CLI

## What even is this? 

Glad you asked. 

This is a small utility written by some fine folks at Automattic.com. It automates and standardizes provisioning new WordPress sites (on Pressable.com), connecting them to code repositories (on GitHub.com) and configuring deploy automation (via DeployHQ.com). It does a few other things, but that's the gist.

## How do I use this?

You probably don't. 

That said, with minimal work and especially if you're already using any of the three service providers we are, you can fork this repo and adapt it to your own needs. Or, perhaps you'll use this tool as inspiration to build something similar which automates a repeatable task you or your team are responsible for.

## May I contribute to this?

Probably not. 

This tool is fairly specific to our team's workflow...and we intend to keep it that way vs. abstracting it for anyone and everyone's needs. That said, we're open to hearing from you and feel free to reach us by opening an issue- please include a reference/link to your favorite song as a clue that you've read this =)

## Why is this named "Team51"

It's the nickname for our Special Projects team at Automattic.

## Anything else?

Be well, be kind, make things and set them free.

## Installation
1. Open the Terminal on your Mac and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if you haven't already).
    - `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
1. Keep your Terminal open and clone this repository by running:
    - `git clone git@github.com:Automattic/team51-cli.git`
    - The Terminal will ask you for a so-called SSH Passphrase which you must type and hit `Enter` (if you're unsure what the passphrase is, try entering the same you'd use for the AutoProxxy).
1. Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed on your computer.
    - The easiest way to install composer is by running `brew install composer`.
1. Make sure you're using [version 8 of 1Password](https://1password.com/mac/).
    - If you've installed it recently, then you probably are.
    - If you've been using 1Password for a while, then you probably need to upgrade manually since v7 doesn't automatically upgrade to v8.
    - Make sure you know the master password to all your 1Password accounts since you'll need to enter it again after the upgrade to v8.
1. Make sure [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/) is installed on your computer.
    - The easiest way to install 1Password CLI is by running `brew install --cask 1password/tap/1password-cli`.
    - The terminal will ask you for a password which should be the same one you use to log in into your computer. After typing it in, hit `Enter`.
    - After installation, [turn on biometric unlocking](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#turn-on-biometric-unlock) to link your existing accounts with the CLI tool, and for convenient unlocking of your vaults later on.
    - Run a simple command, like `op vault ls`, to verify that it works and to select your default account (select the Team51 account if you have more than one).
1. Now let's install the CLI! From the `team51-cli` directory, run `./install-osx`.
    - If you get an error `no such file or directory: ./install-osx`, try running `cd team51-cli` first.
1. To verify the tool was installed successfully, you can run `team51` from your Terminal.

### For contractors
Apart from the steps outlined above, you will also need to perform the following:
1. Copy the file `/secrets/config__contractors.dist.json` to `/secrets/config__contractors.json` (remove the `.dist` part).
1. Populate the fields with the Pressable API credentials received from Team51.

When running any command, you will need to append the flag `--contractor` (or `-c`) to the command.

## Usage
This CLI tool is self-documenting. You can view a list of available commands with `team51 list`.
You can then do `team51 <command-name> --help`.

A copy of that documentation possibly will land here in the future if it's useful.

## Troubleshooting

### Before anything else
If you haven't used the CLI in a while, and you're getting a lot of `Deprecated` notices or PHP `Fatal error`, try running `./install-osx` again to make sure all the dependencies are up-to-date. 

Remember: you need be inside the `team51-cli` directory in order to execute the installation command.

### `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: ...`
If you see this error when running a command, and you don't remember intentionally changing the mentioned files on your computer, you should run `git reset --hard` to discard all the changes and get back to the state of the remote repository.

### `no such file or directory: ./install-osx`
Most likely you are not inside the team51 directory. Try with `cd team51-cli`. If that doesn't work, verify where you are located by running `pwd` and then use the *change directory* command (`cd`) to navigate to the team51-cli directory we cloned in the steps above.

### `composer: command not found`
If you get the error `./install-osx: line 2: composer: command not found`, you can run `brew install composer` to install Composer on your computer.

### `brew: command not found`
If you don't have [brew](https://brew.sh/) yet, install it by executing this from your Terminal: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` â€” Tip: you can use brew to install all sort of apps on your Mac. Give it [a try](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/zoom)

### `failed to open stream: Too many open files`

For certain commands involving the use of PHP workers threads, you might need to increase the `ulimit` on your local computer. To increase this number, you can run on the terminal: `ulimit -n 8192`.

A particular case where this might be needed is when using the `remove-user` command. If you get a `PHP Warning:` `failed to open stream: Too many open files...` try upgrading the ulimit as described above.

### `env: php: No such file or directory`

This is likely because you don't have PHP installed on your system. If you recently updated to MacOS Monterey, that could be the culprit as it doesn't come bundled with PHP anymore. If you have `brew` installed, it's easy to get PHP added by running the following command in the terminal: `brew install php@7.4 brew-php-switcher`. This will install the latest version of PHP 7.4 as well as a handy utility for switching between PHP versions if you need to.

You will then need to run `brew link php@7.4` so that PHP gets symlinked properly to your system's PHP files. Running `team51` now should work just fine.
